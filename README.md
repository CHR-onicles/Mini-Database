#MINI_DATABASE_PROJECT

Just typical simple mini database stuff...
Includes basic functions like adding, displaying, saving to file, deleting etc.
Everything was done in main cuz its a small program I'm using to practise working with files and user input verification
More stuff to be added tho for future reference

TO DO:
-Create function template for checking for text, numbers etc
-Maybe verify phone numbers (BIG MAYBE)


COMPLETED:
-Add save to file when user is exiting
